* Instructor - Prof. Daniel Lopresti

The course is intended for students who plan to take further courses in Computer Science (i.e., CSE 002, which can be taken concurrently, and CSE 017, the next course in the computer science sequence), and for those who want to gain understanding about the breadth of computer science topics as part of a general education. No prior experience with computer programming is assumed. There are no prerequisites.
