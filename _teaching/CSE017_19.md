This course will cover the design and implementation of algorithms using Java.
It assumes that students have had prior experience using conditional statements, loops, arrays, etc., in Java, and
will build on this knowledge to develop a full understanding of proper object-oriented programming, algorithmic
techniques (e.g., divide-and-conquer, recursion), and the design of data structures (e.g., queues, stacks, trees).
