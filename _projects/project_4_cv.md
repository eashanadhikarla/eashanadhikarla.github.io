- Develpoed a robust autoencoder with one-hot memory masking for detecting adversarial attacks.
- The model is a close proximity approximation model that can retreive the relevant memory features of an image and reconstruct it with a repaired label.
- The enhanced deep neural architecture significantly improved the robustness of DNN for image classification task.
