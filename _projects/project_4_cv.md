- The search for applying machine learning to real world problems led me to work in the area of Astro-turfing. This is a filtering model with machine learning algorithm to filter-out the fake reviews and hence the fake reviewers from committing review frauds. I used amazon reviews data sets to built a stochastic model on top of it.
