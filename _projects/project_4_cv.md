- We developed a robust autoencoder with one-hot memory masking to mitigate adversarial attacks.
- The proximity approximation model can retrieve an image's relevant memory features and reconstruct it with a repaired label.
- The enhanced deep neural architecture significantly improved the robustness of DNN for an image classification task.
