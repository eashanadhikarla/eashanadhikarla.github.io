### CSE 160 - Introduction to Data Science (Fall 2021)
Undergraduate Course, Department of Computer Science & Engineering<br>

<b> Instructor </b>- Prof. Brian D. Davison <br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Data Science is an interdisciplinary field focusing on the computational analysis of data to extract knowledge and insight. This course introduces the student to the collection, preparation, analysis, modeling and visualization of data, covering both conceptual and practical issues. Examples from diverse fields will be presented, and hands-on use of statistical and data manipulation software will be included.</p>

### CSE 017 - Programming and Data Structures (Fall 2020)
Undergraduate Course, Department of Computer Science & Engineering<br>

<b> Instructor </b>- Prof. Houria Oudghiri <br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This course will cover the design and implementation of algorithms using Java.
It assumes that students have had prior experience using conditional statements, loops, arrays, etc., in Java, and will build on this knowledge to develop a full understanding of proper object-oriented programming, algorithmic techniques (e.g., divide-and-conquer, recursion), and the design of data structures (e.g., queues, stacks, trees).</p>

### CSE 001 - Breadth of Computing (Fall 2018)
Undergraduate Course, Department of Computer Science & Engineering<br>

<b> Instructor </b>- Prof. Daniel Lopresti <br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The course is intended for students who plan to take further courses in Computer Science (i.e., CSE 002, which can be taken concurrently, and CSE 017, the next course in the computer science sequence), and for those who want to gain understanding about the breadth of computer science topics as part of a general education. No prior experience with computer programming is assumed. There are no prerequisites.</p>
