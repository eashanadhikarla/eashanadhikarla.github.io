<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Welcome to my home page!!!

  <br>
  I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at <a href="https://engineering.lehigh.edu">P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science</a>, Lehigh University, where I am advised by <a href="http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/">Dr. Brian D. Davison</a>. My research interests lie in applied machine learning, computer vision, image processing, and data science. Currently, I am exploring into developing efficient and fast foundation models for computer vision applications on Edge devices. Since 2022, I have been collaborating with Lenovo Research on overall image enhancements and generative AI based restorations on edge devices targeting improvements in model speed, robustness and image quality.
  <br><br>
  I have a strong background in AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), with a Master of Science (M.S.) and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees in Computer Science from Lehigh University and Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya, respectively.
  <br><br>
  I'm always up for a challenge and love working with others to solve problems. If you have an exciting project that you think I'd be a good fit for, please don't hesitate to reach out.
</p>

<strong>For recruiters:</strong>  
<p style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">I am open to the job market for full-time opportunities post summer/mid-fall 2025 onwards‚Äì broadly in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.</p>

  I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Lehigh University's P.C. Rossin College of Engineering, advised by <a href="http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/">Dr. Brian D. Davison</a>.
  <br><br>
  My research is focused on a critical challenge at the forefront of modern AI: **making powerful foundation models for computer vision both efficient and effective for on-device deployment.** I specialize in developing novel, lightweight architectures that push the boundaries of what's possible on edge devices, without compromising on performance, robustness, or image quality.
  <br><br>
  Since 2022, I have been fortunate to collaborate closely with the Computational Photography and Generative AI teams (including **Lenovo Research**, **Motorola Mobility**). Where, I have contributed to developing and optimizing next-generation AI models for image enhancement and controllable restoration, directly tackling real-world challenges in the mobile and edge computing space.
  <br><br>
  I hold Master of Science and Bachelor of Science degrees in Computer Science, which have provided me with a strong and comprehensive foundation in AI and its applications. I am passionate about tackling complex problems, collaborating with creative teams, and translating cutting-edge research into impactful technology.
</p>

<strong>For Recruiters:</strong>
<p style="color: #0056b3; font-weight: bold;">I am actively seeking full-time roles broadly at the intersection of Computer Vision and Machine Learning, suitable for a PhD graduate, with expected availability from late 2025 onward.</p>
