<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi I'm Eashan. I love engaging content, staying well-informed and look for an environment which is conducive to a holistic development of my being. I stay on my toes and am always ready for the challenges life throws at me. :) 
Currently, I live in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania but originally I'm from India. So I try and take advantage of the best that Bethlehem and New York have to offer. I love delving in all the up and coming research topics with sustainable research potential, based on Machine Learning, Data Science and Computer Vision.
<br/><br/>
I'm a graduate researcher and graduate teaching assistant currently pursuing my Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Computer Science, Machine Learning from <a href="https://www1.lehigh.edu">Lehigh University, Bethlehem - Pennsylvania</a>. I recently worked as a Research Intern at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, where I was working with National Energy Research Scientific Computing (<a href="https://www.nersc.gov/">NERSC</a>) group in optimizing the real-time workflows in Cori - 12th fastest supercomputer in the world. I did my Master of Science in Computer Science from Lehigh University, and Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Science from Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya, Bhopal, MP (India). 
Furthermore, I am currently working with <a href="http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/">Dr. Brian D. Davison</a>, director of Web Understanding, Modeling, and Evaluation lab as a Research Assistant on multiple projects that you can find in <a href="https://eashanadhikarla.github.io/projects/">here</a>. I work on Adversarial Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, Data Science, and super computing with emphasis on deep learning. My work mainly deals with massive-scale deep learning and building stochastic optimal neural network models and Software Engineering. Drawing parallels from the quintessential researchers at Lehigh, my post-doctoral goal is to work in a research lab or Industry and contribute extensively to the field of applied deep learning for the betterment of society.</p> <br/>
