<p style="text-align: justify;"> Welcome to my home page! <br>
I am a first year Ph.D. Student at P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science at <a href="https://www1.lehigh.edu">Lehigh University, Bethlehem - Pennsylvania.</a>, where I am fortunately advised by <a href="http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/">Dr. Brian D. Davison</a>, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, Director of Web Understanding, Modeling, and Evaluation (WUME) lab and Associate Director of Institute for Data, Intelligent Systems, and Computation (I-DISC). I received my Master of Science (M.S.) in Computer Science from Lehigh University and Bachelors of Engineering (B.E.) in Computer Science from Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya, Bhopal, MP (India).<br><br>
My research interest lies in the area of deep learning and computer vision. Drawing parallels from the quintessential researchers in my network, my post Ph.D. goal is to work in Industry or research laboratory and contribute extensively to the field of A.I.</p>

<!-- <p style="text-align: justify;">Hi, I'm Eashan. I love engaging content, staying well-informed, and always looking for an environment conducive to the holistic development of my being. I stay on my toes and am always ready for the challenges life throws at me. :)
Currently, I live in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, but originally I'm from India. So I try and take advantage of the best that the east coast has to offer. I love delving into all the up-and-coming research topics with sustainable research potential based on Machine Learning, Data Science, and Computer Vision.

I'm a graduate researcher and graduate teaching assistant currently pursuing my Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Computer Science (Data Science & Machine Learning) from <a href="https://www1.lehigh.edu">Lehigh University, Bethlehem - Pennsylvania.</a>, where I am fortunately advised by <a href="http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/">Dr. Brian D. Davison</a>, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, Director of Web Understanding, Modeling, and Evaluation (WUME) lab and Associate Director of Institute for Data, Intelligent Systems, and Computation (I-DISC). I completed my Master of Science (M.S.) in Computer Science from Lehigh University and Bachelors of Engineering (B.E.) in Computer Science from Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya, Bhopal, MP (India). I specialize in adversarial machine learning, data science, and computer vision, emphasizing deep learning. My work revolves around a broad area of data science, building stochastic optimal neural network models, and software engineering. Drawing parallels from the quintessential researchers at Lehigh, my post Ph.D. goal is to work in Industry or research laboratory and contribute extensively to the field of deep learning.</p><br/> -->
