I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science <a href="https://engineering.lehigh.edu">P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science</a> at <a href="https://www1.lehigh.edu">Lehigh University, where I am advised by <a href="http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/">Dr. Brian D. Davison</a>. My research interests lie in applied machine learning, computer vision, image processing, and data science. I am particularly interested in the robustness of machine learning models in a data-centric paradigm. Currently, I am supported by Lenovo Research and working on low-light image enhancements for improving model robustness and image quality.

Davison</a>, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering. My research broadly lies in applied machine learning, computer vision, image processing and data science. In particular, I work on the robustness of machine learning models in a data-centric paradigm. Currently, I'm exploring the low-light image enhancements for improving model robustness, image quality. Drawing parallels from the quintessential researchers in my network, my post Ph.D. goal is to work in an industrial research laboratory or national laboratory, and contribute extensively to the field of A.I. -->
