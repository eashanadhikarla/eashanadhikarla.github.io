  Welcome to my home page!!!

  <br>
  I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://engineering.lehigh.edu">P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science</a>, Lehigh University, where I am advised by <a href="http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/">Dr. Brian D. Davison</a>. My research interests lie in applied machine learning, computer vision, image processing, and data science. I am particularly interested in the robustness of machine learning models in a data-centric paradigm. Currently, I am collaborating with MTI Lab at Lenovo Research and working on overall image enhancements on edge devices targeting improvements in model robustness and image quality with exposure related challenges.
  <br><br>
  I have a strong background in AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), with a Master of Science (M.S.) and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees in Computer Science from Lehigh University and Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya, respectively.
  <br><br>
  I'm always up for a challenge and love working with others to solve problems. If you have an exciting project that you think I'd be a good fit for, please don't hesitate to reach out.
