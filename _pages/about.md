<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Welcome to my home page!!!
  <br>
    <img align="right" src="https://eashanadhikarla.github.io/images/dp.png" alt="Photo" style="width: 45%; height: 50%; border-radius: 40px; padding: 25px 25px 25px 25px"/>
  <br>
  I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at <a href="https://engineering.lehigh.edu">P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science</a>, Lehigh University, where I am advised by <a href="http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/">Dr. Brian D. Davison</a>. My research interests lie in applied machine learning, computer vision, image processing, and data science. Currently, I am exploring into developing efficient and fast foundation models for computer vision applications on Edge devices. Since 2022, I have been collaborating with Lenovo Research on overall image enhancements and generative AI based restorations on edge devices targeting improvements in model speed, robustness and image quality.
  <br><br>
  I have a strong background in AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), with a Master of Science (M.S.) and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees in Computer Science from Lehigh University and Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya, respectively.
  <br><br>
  I'm always up for a challenge and love working with others to solve problems. If you have an exciting project that you think I'd be a good fit for, please don't hesitate to reach out.

<strong>For recruiters:</strong>  
<p style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">I am open to the job market for full-time opportunities post summer/mid-fall 2025 onwards‚Äì broadly in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.</p>
