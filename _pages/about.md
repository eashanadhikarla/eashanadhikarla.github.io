<p style="text-align: justify;"> <br><br>Welcome to my home page! <br><br>
I am a second year Ph.D. Student at P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science at <a href="https://www1.lehigh.edu">Lehigh University, Bethlehem - Pennsylvania.</a>, where I am fortunately advised by <a href="http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/">Dr. Brian D. Davison</a>, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, Director of Web Understanding, Modeling, and Evaluation (WUME) lab and Associate Director of Institute for Data, Intelligent Systems, and Computation (I-DISC). I received my Master of Science (M.S.) in Computer Science from Lehigh University and Bachelors of Engineering (B.E.) in Computer Science from Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya, Bhopal, MP (India).<br><br>
My research interest lies in the area of deep learning and computer vision. Drawing parallels from the quintessential researchers in my network, my post Ph.D. goal is to work in Industry or research laboratory and contribute extensively to the field of A.I.</p>
