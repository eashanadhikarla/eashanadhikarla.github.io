Welcome to my home page!!!

<br>
I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science <a href="https://engineering.lehigh.edu">P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science</a> at <a href="https://www1.lehigh.edu">Lehigh University</a>, where I am advised by <a href="http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/">Dr. Brian D. Davison</a>. My research interests lie in applied machine learning, computer vision, image processing, and data science. I am particularly interested in the robustness of machine learning models in a data-centric paradigm. Currently, I am supported by Lenovo Research and working on low-light image enhancements for improving model robustness and image quality.
<br><br>
I have a strong background in AI, with a Master of Science (M.S.) and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees in Computer Science from Lehigh University and Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya, respectively.
<br><br>
I'm always up for a challenge and love working with others to solve problems. If you have an exciting project that you think I'd be a good fit for, please don't hesitate to reach out.
