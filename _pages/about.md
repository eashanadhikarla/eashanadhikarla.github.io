<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi, I'm Eashan. I love engaging content, staying well-informed, and always looking for an environment conducive to the holistic development of my being. I stay on my toes and am always ready for the challenges life throws at me. :)
Currently, I live in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, but originally I'm from India. So I try and take advantage of the best that the east coast has to offer. I love delving into all the up-and-coming research topics with sustainable research potential based on Machine Learning, Data Science, and Computer Vision.
<br/><br/>
I'm a graduate researcher and graduate teaching assistant currently pursuing my Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Computer Science (Data Science & Machine Learning) from <a href="https://www1.lehigh.edu">Lehigh University, Bethlehem - Pennsylvania.</a>, where I am fortunately advised by <a href="http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/">Dr. Brian D. Davison</a>, Director of Web Understanding, Modeling, and Evaluation lab and Associate Director of Institute for Data, Intelligent Systems, and Computation (I-DISC). I completed my Master of Science (M.S.) in Computer Science from Lehigh University and Bachelors of Engineering (B.E.) in Computer Science from Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya, Bhopal, MP (India). I specialize in adversarial machine learning, data science, and computer vision, emphasizing deep learning. My work revolves around a broad area of data science, building stochastic optimal neural network models, and software engineering. Drawing parallels from the quintessential researchers at Lehigh, my post Ph.D. goal is to work in a research laboratory or Industry and contribute extensively to the field of deep learning.</p><br/>

<!-- Furthermore, I am currently working with <a href="http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/">Dr. Brian D. Davison</a>, Director of Web Understanding, Modeling, and Evaluation lab and Associate Director of Institute for Data, Intelligent Systems and Computation (I-DISC), as a Research Assistant on multiple projects that you can find in <a href="https://eashanadhikarla.github.io/projects/">here</a>. I work on Adversarial Machine Learning, Data Science, and Computer Vision, emphasizing deep learning. My work mainly deals with massive-scale deep learning and building stochastic optimal neural network models, and Software Engineering. Drawing parallels from the quintessential researchers at Lehigh, my post-doctoral goal is to work in a research lab or Industry and contribute extensively to the field of applied deep learning for the betterment of society.</p> <br/> -->
