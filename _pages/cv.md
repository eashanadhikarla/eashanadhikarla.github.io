* Peer Mentor, <b>National Science Foundation (NSF-REU) 2020</b> (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1757787">CNS-1757787</a>)
  * Mentoring and closely guiding 15 NSF-REU Interns on their respective site projects.
  * Duties included: Weekly one-on-one discussions with each intern, understanding their fallouts and helping them out with their codes and other low level academic issues.

* Research Assistant, <b>Resilience Research Group for SARS-CoV-2</b> (<a href="https://converge.colorado.edu/resources/covid-19/working-groups/issues-impacts-recovery/cultural-perceptions-of-risk-behavioral-responses-and-community-resilience-in-covid-19">NSF Award 1841338</a>)
  * Image Gathering for face-masks in United States.
  * Designing a novel face-mask detection algorithm for a survey research on SARS-CoV-2.
  * Supervisor: <a href="http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/">Dr. Brian D. Davison</a>

* Research Intern, <b>Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, NERSC</b> (<a href="https://cs.lbl.gov/news-media/news/2019/summer-student-researchers-wrap-up/"><i>link</i></a>) <!-- Embedded Link: https://cdn.cp.adobe.io/content/2/video/3d0f97fc-0135-492b-b4f0-6c0d269cc2d7/embed?api_key=MarvelCP1 -->
  * Developed scripts to fetch and analyze terabytes of data from the SLURM scheduler.
  * Analyzed & estimated real-time queues in the scheduler for optimizing the policies for incoming jobs.
  * Developed three real-time policies that potentially improved the allocation procedure.
    * Draining
    * Job Cancellation
    * Job Pausing
  * Supervisor: <a href="https://www.nersc.gov/about/nersc-staff/advanced-technologies-group/brian-austin/">Dr. Brian Austin</a>

* Machine Learning Intern, <b>Persistent Systems ltd</b> (<a href="https://github.com/eashanadhikarla/Facial-Recognition-with-DNN"><i>link</i></a>)
  * Developed a facial recognition and verification system using Google's FaceNET research as the baseline.
  * Added additional OpenCV features on top of it, which can differentiate between 3-D and 2-D images.
  * Designed a purely browser-based RSA compliant module to work with FIDO keys.

Projects
========
* <b>Robust Adversarial Filter</b> (Python, PyTorch) (<a href="https://github.com/eashanadhikarla/seqGAN">link</a>)
  * Currently designing a robust auto-encoder and GAN for detecting adversarial images. Developed a close proximity approximation model which is also known as on manifold adversarial detectors. Enhanced the vanilla auto-encoder to a deep architecture with enforced learning from memory elements.

* <b>Sequence Generative Adversarial Nets with Policy Gradient</b> (Python, PyTorch) (<a href="https://github.com/eashanadhikarla/seqGAN">link</a>)
  * Seq-GAN is a unique approach which models the data generator as a stochastic policy in reinforcement learning to solve the problem.
  * The RL reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence, and is passed back to the intermediate state- action steps using Monte Carlo search.

* <b>Facial Recognition and Verification System</b> (Python) (<a href="https://github.com/eashanadhikarla/Facial-Recognition-with-DNN">link</a>)
  * Realtime recognition system focused on mobile devices.
  * Overcame the challenge of keeping a low false-positive rate by developing a unique approach learning directly from 128-D embedding into a Euclidean space.

Small Academic Projects
======
* <b>Image & Text Annotation using Reinforcement Learning</b> (Python) (<a href=" https://github.com/eashanadhikarla/Image-Text-Annotation-Using-Reinforcement-Learning">link</a>)
  * In this team project, I build a deep learning model using Inception V3 as my base to extract features from the images and to pass on the feature array vector to the text annotation model in whole to generate a multi-arm bandit algorithm with a challenge of very little labelled data.

* <b>Predicting the attractiveness of the list of products on Amazon</b> (Python) (<a href="https://github.com/eashanadhikarla/product_listing_attractiveness">link</a>)
  * The quality of product listing is crucial for improving search relevance and gaining customer attention. I had implemented a neural network model with the help of keras text processing to learn the amazon dataset after feature engineering and cleaning the data. 

* <b>Two-Phase Commit Replicated Hash Table</b> (C++, Bash, Amazon EC2) (<a href="https://github.com/eashanadhikarla/Atomic-Commit-Protocol-2PC">link</a>)
  * Implemented a hash table which ensures distributed atomic transactions in the system. It replicates every operation as backup on separate node for recovery phase.

* <b>Twitter Trend Analysis of data to create high frequency contextual word</b> (C++, MongoDB, HTML5) (<a href="https://github.com/eashanadhikarla/Twitter-Trend-Analyzer">link</a>)
  * Using twitter data to do analysis and extract the most frequently used dictionary for political campaign. This application has been been implemented in C++ and MongoDB back-end.
